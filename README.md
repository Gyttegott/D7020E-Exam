# Klee based analysis.

## Exam
Details are found in `klee.py`

## Complilation

Use a Rust toolchain with a llvm4 backend, e.g., nightly-2018-01-10-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.

> rustup override set nightly-2018-01-10-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu

> xargo build --example panic1 --features klee_mode --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu

The `--features klee_mode` implies the following:

- the set of tasks is generated in ./klee/tasks.txt
- the example is built without HW dependencies 
  claim does NOT affect basepri register

The `--target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` implies the following:

``` text
rustflags = [
  "--emit=llvm-bc,llvm-ir",
  "-C", "linker=true"
]
```

So both `.bc` and `.ll` are generated for the application at hand (`panic1.rs`). (Only `.bc` is indeed needed/used for KLEE analysis, but the `.ll` is neat as being human readable for code inspection).

The files will contain all symbols besides the *weakly* defined default handlers (which should not be analysed by KLEE in any case).

TODO: there is still a warning on module level assembly.

The `--release` flag implies:

``` text
[profile.release]
lto = true
debug = true
panic = "abort"
```

`lto = true` ensures pre-llvm linking of dependencies for the generated `.bc` and `.ll` files.

`panic = "abort"` is required to override the default panic (unwrap) behavior of the x86 (host) target.



## KLEE Analysis

A docker daemon should be started/enabled.

> systemctl start docker.service # if not already started/enabled

In the current folder:

```
arm-none-eabi-gdb -x gdb.py
```

The script will build for both KLEE and the MCU, run the KLEE tests and then proceed with testing the KLEE-generated values on the MCU.



The steps described separately:

### Compilation of KLEE input

```
xargo build --example example_name --features klee_mode --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```
or for analysis on optimized code (you may need to do manually)

```
xargo build --release --example example_name --features klee_mode --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

### Compilation for benchmarking on MCU

```
xargo build --release --example example_name  --features wcet_bkpt --target thumbv7em-none-eabihf
```

### Running KLEE


> docker run --rm --user $(id -u):$(id -g) -v $PWD/target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/examples:/mnt -w /mnt -it afoht/llvm-klee-4 /bin/bash

or 
> docker run --rm --user $(id -u):$(id -g) -v $PWD/target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/debug/examples:/mnt -w /mnt -it afoht/llvm-klee-4 /bin/bash

This starts a shell in the docker `llvm-klee-4`, with a shared mount to the examples directory, where your `panic1-xxxx.bc` is located.

From there you can run various commands like:

> klee panic1-xxxxx.bc

To emit all the different errors, use

> klee --emit-all-errors panic1-xxxxx.bc

this will generate a test-file for each and every path encountered.

See KLEE for detailed information.
